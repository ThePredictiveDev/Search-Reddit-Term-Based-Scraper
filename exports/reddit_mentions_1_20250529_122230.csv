1262,6,1ky69er,unknown,High school student passionate about neuroscience + AI ‚Äî looking for beginner-friendly project ideas!,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm a 16-year-old Grade 12 student from India, currently preparing for my NEET medical entrance exam. But alongside that, I‚Äôm also really passionate about artificial intelligence and neuroscience.

My long-term goal is to pursue AI + neuroscience.

I already know Java, and I‚Äôm starting to learn Python now so I can work on AI projects. 


I‚Äôd love your suggestions for:

‚Ä¢ Beginner-friendly AI + neuroscience project ideas.
‚Ä¢ Open datasets I can explore.
‚Ä¢ Tips for combining Python coding with brain-related applications.


If you were in my shoes, what would you start learning or building first?

Thank you so much; excited to learn from this amazing community!

1205,6,1ky6bv9,unknown,how to make the most of summer break?,"I'm in a t3 college and just finished my first year. we were taught c, python (first sem) and c++ (second sem) as part of our curriculum. I personally also know a bit about java as well. in these two semesters we weren't taught any of these languages in depth. next sem I'm gonna be having dsa which will most probably in c/c++ I think. how should I make the most of this ~2 month sem break and focus on which programming language(s) and from where. 


also I'm quite interested in finance and economics and will also be trying to complete one course side by side so if anyone has any recommendations for any courses on that it'll be quite appreciated ... im thinking of focusing a bit on finance related stuff in whatever holidays I get and focusing more on cse stuff and courses during semesters.",NoHumor9325,Btechtards,https://reddit.com/r/Btechtards/comments/1ky6bv9/how_to_make_the_most_of_summer_break/,6,6,,2025-05-29T14:51:17,2025-05-29T12:21:54.656435,0.23461538461538464,0.4

1276,6,1ky6a4z,unknown,Taming Excel Chaos in SaaS Ops‚ÄîHow Would You Automate It?,"Hey everyone‚Äîfirst off, I‚Äôm here to learn and help, not just take. üéØ

In my small SaaS team, we‚Äôve spent countless hours every month wrestling with Excel exports for:

* Monthly MRR/ARR reports with inconsistent headers
* Cleaning up churn and upgrade data across multiple sheets
* Auto-refreshing our sales pipeline summaries
* Generating ‚Äútop 10 customers by spend‚Äù charts
* Bulk lookups to join customer info with billing records

We eventually built a few in-house Python scripts (and yes, some VBA!) to flatten multi-row headers, auto-build pivots, and normalize date formats‚Äîbut it still feels clunky and maintenance-heavy.

**So I‚Äôm curious:**  
If you had an ‚ÄúAI assistant‚Äù for Excel in your SaaS business, **what 5‚Äì10 tasks** would you hand off first?

And for those who‚Äôve already automated parts of their workflow‚Äîwhat libraries or low-code tools worked best for you?

1219,6,1ky6d34,unknown,Is it worth it to do master,"M26 with 3 years of working experience in back office. 2024 TC was around 110K.

I'm currently working in trade processing for a foreign financial services firm, but I‚Äôm really trying to move into something more data-focused. My original goal was to get into banking FO, but I ended up in the BO because it was the first job offer I got and at the time, I just wanted to get my foot in the door.

That said, I‚Äôve naturally gravitated toward data work in my current role. I‚Äôve managed to cut down a significant amount of both my own and the department‚Äôs workload through automation. Over time, I've become the ""data guy"" in the KL office. If anyone needs help with data-related stuff, they usually come to me as it is easier than reaching out to the Europe data team in the interest of time.

I even got pulled into a project to handle data management and analysis, and ended up building a full ETL pipeline for the whole kl branch. I maintain the datasets and tooling, automate data activities, process high volume data and design and implement data pipelines and data models for analytics. Since we don‚Äôt have a local data team here, I‚Äôve basically filled that gap. Even the Europe data/IT team reaches out to me when they need something from KL. But despite all this, my title is still just ""trade processing,"" and I still have to do all my usual BAU tasks. I'm expected to do both 50-50.

I‚Äôve brought this up in pretty much every 1-on-1 with my manager, but there‚Äôs been no real progress...because we already have data team in Europe and my work is just a side project. Internal transfers aren‚Äôt an option either, so I‚Äôve started applying externally for data analyst and data engineering roles. I‚Äôve got experience with SQL, Python, AWS, Databricks, Snowflake, VBA, and Power BI but so far, I haven‚Äôt had much luck with applications.

Now I‚Äôm wondering if I need to take it a step further. Should I go for a Master‚Äôs in Data Science in UM, or would it make more sense to focus on certifications like the AWS and Databricks Data Engineer certs to boost my chances? And realistically‚Ä¶ is doing a full-time Master‚Äôs while working a 9‚Äì6 job just asking for suicide?",flyingenchiladas789,MalaysianPF,https://reddit.com/r/MalaysianPF/comments/1ky6d34/is_it_worth_it_to_do_master/,9,5,,2025-05-29T14:53:35,2025-05-29T12:21:54.655435,0.12123263888888891,0.3

1257,6,1ky6qaf,unknown,"plugin ideas, but not sure how to code them","Hi. I want to build 2 plugins for OsmAnd:

* One for coordinates conversion. It'd allow the user to enter X/Y coordinates in any reference system (lookup by keyword or by EPSG:xxxxx), and it would output the converted coordinates in common angular coords WGS84 or in a selected other reference system, and it would let the user just click on a button to zoom in to that location on the map. It should pack all the reference conversions for offline use, it should work fully offline.
* One for self-service bike rental systems. Many of these rental systems provide APIs that show the capacity and available bikes at given stations, each station has an id, etc; and many of these bike rental systems are correctly mapped into OSM with all the required data. I'm guessing that minimal ""local"" modifications should be made to make this work (either on the plugin side, or batch-modify OSM data in cities where tagging deviates from the norm). I want to build a plugin that will somehow display stations with available bikes, or display the number of available bikes/return slots.

Now, my problem: I'm now sure how to go about doing all that. I've seen some plugins that are basically zip files with json files instructing where to copy rendering or other ""simple"" files into the OsmAnd running directory (or something like that).

However when exploring the OsmAnd repo, I'm seeing that the ""core"" plugins seem much more involved: https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd/tree/master/OsmAnd/src/net/osmand/plus/plugins. I'd like to build my plugins myself, but I'd need some guidance.

Would I need to write java flies and re-compile the entire app? Or would there be a way for these plugins to be modular? If the plugin is then part of the core app, it doesn't feel like a plugin anymore? If modular, how to go about coding this?

I can code in python and I'm used to dealing with APIs, I'm generally ""computer-literate"", but I know little about Android and java dev. Willing to spend the time it takes to learn, just need to get started.

1243,6,1ky7162,unknown,Managing Multiple Python Versions and venvs in a UV Project,"Hello!

First, let me give you some context.  
I'm using **UV** (from Astral) to manage Git repositories for my Python scripts. I use `uv init` to create a repository with its own `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files. Then, I use `uv add` to create a `.venv` and install all the libraries I need for my scripts. So far, everything works as expected.

However, I‚Äôve run into a problem. I‚Äôm working in a repository that requires **Python &gt;=3.12**, but inside a specific subfolder (let‚Äôs call it `test`), I have scripts that require **Python 3.11.9** and some libraries with specific versions to avoid compatibility issues.

UV manages all dependencies and updates the `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and `.python-version` files accordingly.

Here‚Äôs the issue:  
When I run `uv init --python 3.11.9` inside the `test` folder, it correctly creates a `pyproject.toml`. All good so far.  
But when I run `uv add` to install dependencies, it throws a version error because it tries to use the virtual environment from the **parent folder**, not the one in `test`.

Even when the Python version matches, the new dependencies are written into the `pyproject.toml` inside `test`, but it still uses the venv from the main project folder, no new virtual environment is created in `test`.

What I need is one virtual environment (with its own dependencies and lock files) for the general repository, and a separate virtual environment (with its own files) for the `test` folder.

I‚Äôve looked through the documentation but couldn‚Äôt find anything that worked for me. Any ideas?

[[Explore Top Rated snakeskin boots on Amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=snakeskin boots)

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and style of snakeskin boots vary significantly depending on the materials used, construction methods, and design details. Understanding these key features will help you choose a pair that meets your specific needs and preferences.

**Genuine Snakeskin vs. Faux Leather**

Genuine snakeskin boots are made from the actual skin of snakes, typically python, rattlesnake, or anaconda. This material boasts a unique scale pattern and a natural texture that's difficult to replicate.Faux snakeskin, on the other hand, is a synthetic material designed to mimic the appearance of real snakeskin. While genuine snakeskin offers superior durability and a luxurious feel, it can be more expensive and requires specialized care. Faux leather is a more affordable and easier-to-maintain option, but it may lack the depth and richness of real snakeskin.

**Boot Height and Silhouette**

Snakeskin boots come in various heights and silhouettes, ranging from ankle booties to knee-high designs. ankle boots are versatile and can be paired with jeans, skirts, or dresses.Mid-calf boots offer a more dramatic look and are ideal for wearing with longer skirts or over leggings.Knee-high boots make a bold statement and are well-suited for special occasions. The silhouette of the boot, whether its a classic cowboy style, a sleek stiletto, or a chunky platform, also contributes to the overall aesthetic.

**Heel Type and Height**

The heel type and height significantly impact the comfort and style of snakeskin boots. Common heel types include block heels, stiletto heels, Cuban heels, and wedge heels. Block heels provide stability and support, making them a comfortable choice for everyday wear. Stiletto heels offer a more elegant and complex look but might potentially be less practical for long periods of walking. Cuban heels, often found on cowboy boots, add a touch of Western flair. Wedge heels provide height and comfort, making them a popular option for those who want to elongate their legs without sacrificing stability.

**color and Pattern**

Snakeskin boots are available in a wide array of colors and patterns, from natural browns and grays to vibrant blues, greens, and pinks. The color of the snakeskin can significantly influence the boot's versatility. Neutral tones, like beige and brown, are easier to match with different outfits, while bolder colors make a statement but may require more careful styling. The pattern of the snakeskin can also vary, with some boots featuring large, prominent scales and others displaying more subtle, intricate designs. Some boots may be dyed or embossed to create unique patterns and textures.**Construction and Durability**

The construction quality of snakeskin boots determines their durability and longevity. Look for boots with sturdy stitching, reinforced soles, and well-crafted uppers. The type of leather used for the lining and insole can also affect the boot's comfort and breathability. Boots with leather linings tend to be more comfortable and durable then those with synthetic linings.Pay attention to the craftsmanship and materials used to ensure that your boots will withstand regular wear and tear.

Genuine snakeskin boots require specialized care to maintain their appearance and prevent damage.Avoid exposing them to excessive moisture or direct sunlight,as this can cause the skin to dry out and crack. Clean them regularly with a soft cloth and a specialized leather cleaner designed for exotic skins. Store them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight, using boot trees to help maintain their shape.**Is it ethical to buy genuine snakeskin boots?**
The ethical implications of buying genuine snakeskin products are a valid concern. Look for brands that source their snakeskin from lasting and responsible suppliers who adhere to ethical harvesting practices.Some brands may also use snakeskin sourced from snakes raised for the food industry, minimizing waste.

**How do I style snakeskin boots?**
Snakeskin boots can be styled in various ways, depending on the occasion and your personal style. For a casual look, pair them with jeans, a t-shirt, and a leather jacket. For a dressier occasion, wear them with a little black dress or a midi skirt. Consider the color and pattern of your boots when choosing your outfit. Neutral tones are easier to match, while bolder colors should be paired with more subdued pieces.**What is the difference between snakeskin print and embossed snakeskin?**
Snakeskin print refers to a printed pattern on leather or synthetic material that mimics the appearance of snakeskin. Embossed snakeskin, on the other hand, involves pressing a snakeskin pattern into the leather to create a raised texture. Neither of these options use actual snakeskin, providing a more affordable and ethical alternative.

1295,6,1ky781y,unknown,Any founders actively looking for jobs? My side project could help,"Hey everyone,

I've been working on¬†[First 2 Apply](https://first2apply.com/)¬†for a little over a year now. It's making some money, but not enough for me to quit my full time job. So I thought others might be in the same boat.

If you're actively searching for a job, I'd recommend giving f2a a try (shocking, I know). Here's why I think it's useful:

* when searching for multiple types of jobs (backend, full stack, frontend, QA etc) you have to keep a ton of tabs open and refresh them constantly. F2a takes this pain away by aggregating everything in a single feed
* more than 50% of jobs are rubbish. If you're a dev, most likely you're specialized in a certain stack so you wouldn't apply to a fullstack job that requires python when you only know nodejs. With advanced matching you get to skip having to go through all of those irellevant jobs. Although the plan is a bit expensive, I agree (OpenAI api costs unfortunately).
* setting up email alerts on different job boards is annoying because you get separate emails from all of them. F2a also fixes this by sending a single email with new listings from all job boards.
* speed is key nowadays: with job boards you only get new job alerts once a day. With f2a you can go as granular as every 30min.

I've also made it open source if you want to host it yourself instead of paying a subscription:¬†[https://github.com/beastx-ro/first2apply](https://github.com/beastx-ro/first2apply)

1155,6,1ky7gx1,unknown,"Is a degree really necessary in my case, or just a nice-to-have?","!!!!! PLEASE NO HATE IN THE COMMENTS!!!!!

I‚Äôd like some real talk from people in the field.

So I started off as a self taught person. I currently work in the engineering department of a tech company and have years of experience. I consistently work alongside fellow engineers and attend events/training sessions from Fortinet and Cisco. My role also includes consulting and sales, so I‚Äôm not just on the technical side but also work directly with clients and vendors.

I'm asking this because a good friend in my field said to me that I am already where a lot of people with degrees want to be so that's why I'm asking.

My certs so far:

CCNP Security 

CCNA

FortiGate Administrator

FortiAnalyzer Analyst

FortiEDR

FortiSwitch Specialist

Python

More certs always in progress ‚Äî I‚Äôm always studying and improving.


Given all this, I‚Äôm wondering:

Is getting a degree actually necessary at this point in my career ‚Äî or is it just a bonus for certain job checkboxes or to satisfy HR?


I‚Äôm based in Jamaica, if that context helps, but I‚Äôm also thinking about remote work or possible relocation in the future. I‚Äôve looked into places like University of the People for a low-cost degree just to ‚Äúcheck the box,‚Äù but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs even worth it anymore.

Would love to hear from people who‚Äôve been there.

Do employers actually care about degrees when someone already has certs, experience, and a solid track record?

Thanks in advance.

1281,6,1ky7lge,unknown,Considering getting the Galaxy book 4 (base variant) as a student work-book,"As per the title, I am a student in India. I really like the look and features of the Samsung galaxy book 4 (intel core 5 120U, 16GB/521GB). I think that this laptop will meet my needs. I don't game much, so I don't plan on running heavy games. I am not a programmer but I occasionally run a few basic data processing programs (Python and R), I will use it mainly to work on docs, and spreadsheets, attend online meetings, and run the basic apps a college student may need, and to watch movies and stuff.

So, what I need is a smooth device with the basics well covered and a good battery life, screen and camera. I heard this device also has a pretty great screen. I am also looking to buy this to use for upwards of 4-5 years. What I would like to ask is, will this laptop last that long while performing at close to its peak performance, and is service and repair easily available and affordable for these devices? These galaxy books have only been out for about 5 years so I can't seem to find any comments or reviews on their reliability as they age. I would appreciate anyone who could share their experience/informed opinion.

1285,6,1ky7llt,unknown,Is it worth to switch from Linux to Mac Air M4 for QoL improvements?,"I'm a DevOps enginner and I've using linux (Ubuntu and Mint) for 2+ years as my full-time work OS. I usually work with Cloud Platforms, K8s, docker, terraform, etc., some programming (python and JS) and also the mac shell should be similar to bash so the switch shouldn't be a problem. 

My current laptop is Acer Swift 3 14"" (AMD Ryzen 7 5700U, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD) with Mint which cost me 640 EUR.  I'm relatively happy with, but I have some problems like: 

* I use Teams a lot, so I need to use it in browser. Sometimes it doesnt see my headphones and mic, and I f's me over especially when I'm running late to a meeting. Usually I'm so paranoid I connect to a call 5-10mins before just to troubleshoot if everything is OK. Slack and Google meets works ok.
* Also Azure VDI, I unfortunately need to use it for my work, it does not have a linux app and the browser version sucks, the screen tears, the clipboard works only 50% of time and I cannot use multiple monitors.
* Similar stuff as I mentioned before, sometimes client requires usage of some software which doesn't exist on linux or it's linux version is crap or even does not work (yes I'm looking at you Palo Alto). Then you need to spend time looking for a workaround instead of working on the actual project.
* Also docks drive me crazy, I don't know if it is Linux or the dock problem (I tilt little bit to linux as lot of colleagues who use linux have problem with docks). Sometimes the screens don't work and I need to do some black magic like dis/re-connect the monitors. Also at home I use steamdeck dock and sometimes if I disconnect a monitor, my whole laptop blacks out and I need force shutdown to fix it.
* Sometimes I forget I have only 16GB of RAM so when I make time laptop freeze, sometimes not even the terminal session without GUI will let me kill the processes, thus forcing me to force shutdown as well.
* Another thing that comes to my mind is battery life. For 80% of time I'm plugged in, but I also do 24/7 oncalls, while I need to be available I still like to live a little and go out and take my laptop with me. My laptop with linux has around 2-4hours battery life and I usually carry a powerbank (it weights 600g, so +50% to the weight of the laptop), which would let me to use it like a one more charge. So I would like to move around with a relax mindset of me not needing to be around places with an outlet to charge if shit went down. I feel like Air M4 (even though the battery life is up to 18hours) has at least 10hours of battery life for normal usage. Is this true?

There are probably another minor things. But these QoL things made me start thinking about switching to mac.

I'm looking at MacBook Air 13"" M4 (32GB RAM, 512GB SSD) for 1920 EUR. I currently have only 220GB full on my disk, and I can probably clean out 50-100GB of things I don't need but with 600GB+ free I'm not in rush. I think 512GB will be enough, but tell me if I'm wrong.

I'm finally getting to the question, do you think it is worth it to upgrade just for the QoL improvements? Will the switch fix all the problems or while it will there are some Mac problems which I should expect?  
For me the deal-breaker is if it worth to invest 3x the price of my current laptop, and I'm afraid I will be disappointed and the experience will not be as smooth as I imagined.   
As for the price, it isn't a problem and I can afford it but also it isn't a small sum, I can imagine investing it into finally buying a nice gaming PC (and saving some money) or going on a nice holiday with my GF.

What do you think, or do you have experience with switching from linux to mac and do you regret it or not?",_pand4,mac,https://reddit.com/r/mac/comments/1ky7llt/is_it_worth_to_switch_from_linux_to_mac_air_m4/,0,5,,2025-05-29T16:12:41,2025-05-29T12:21:54.627436,0.02030400155400155,0.3

1232,6,1ky7vbn,unknown,What do I do with this PulseEffects issue?,"I have been using Arch+hyprland for a while now, but never really felt the need for a volume mixer/equalizer. So I finally caved in and decided to get a volume equalizer. I installed pulseadio and some plugins of pulseaudio from [Arch wiki pulseaudio page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PulseAudio). I then wanted to go for a graphical based front end from the list provided in the same page, and found PulseEffects to my liking. The pulseaudio got installed correctly, but pulseeffects installation is failing with this error:

the error is in pulse\_info\_ui.cpp file, with multiple fields missing, like 'child', 'ipstream', 'pipestream' etc.

Here's certain things to note:  
While installing pulseeffects, I got 2 providers to install from: pulseeffects-legacy(for non pipewire) and pulseeffects-legacy-git(for pipewire). I tried with both and yet it didn't work.  
  
I could've opened the file and check and see, but the files don't exist because the installtion failed. 

during installation, I was again given 2 providers to choose from for ""clap host"": qtractor and reaper. I chose qtractor as it seemed to be more documented online.

My question is, is there a way to resolve this? I checked online a lot, but no forums have this addressed.   
My other question is, if this is unsolveable, can you suggest another good graphical based frontend for volume equaliser?

After that I was part of some most critical client projects and its been 6 months and i have around 3000 pull requests. I worked very hard as i have always liked coding and logic building.

1269,6,1ky8in4,unknown,LIDA - Tool for data visualization,"**Pricing**: One-time/USD

**Category**: data visualization

**Release Date**: 2023

**About Tool:** LIDA is a powerful tool that automates data exploration and generates visualizations and infographics using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT4.  It provides a conversational interface for automatic generation of grammar-agnostic visualizations from data. LIDA consists of four modules: the Summarizer, which converts data into a compact natural language summary; the Goal Explorer, which enumerates visualization goals based on the data; the VisGenerator, which generates, refines, executes, and filters visualization code; and the Infographer, which produces data-faithful stylized graphics using image generation models.LIDA is compatible with any programming language or visualization grammar, allowing users to create visualizations in Python (e.g., Altair, Matplotlib, Seaborn), R, C++, and more.  It also offers operations on existing visualizations, such as visualization explanation, self-evaluation, automatic repair, and recommendation.The tool supports various capabilities, including data summarization, automated data exploration, grammar-agnostic visualizations, and infographics generation.  It leverages the language modeling and code-writing capabilities of LLMs, enabling core automated visualization capabilities. LIDA also provides operations on generated visualizations, such as visualization explanation, self-evaluation, visualization repair, and visualization recommendations.LIDA's architecture combines LLMs and image generation models (IGMs) to address the multi-stage generation problem of visualization creation.  It is open-source and offers a Python API and a hybrid user interface for interactive chart, infographic, and data story generation.While LIDA has limitations with visualization grammars not well-represented in the LLM's training dataset and performance variations depending on the choice of visualization libraries and code generation capabilities, it remains a powerful tool for automating the visualization generation process.

1268,6,1ky8obt,unknown,"Web/mobile product showcase: Godot, Model Viewer or paid toolkit?","I am a long time lurker here and haven't done anything with Godot aside from a few tutorials.  
My main experience is CAD-design (more than 10 years with Siemens NX professionally) and I program with Python as a hobby at a level of 2/5 I'd say. 

My question to you guys: 

Is it realistic to use Godot as my GUI and visualization core for an online application that allows users to upload STLs or STEP files, and download STLs and STEP files? Ideally, the visualization should include simple animation, like explosion views of assemblies and maybe dynamic textures. Alteration of uploaded models (adding holes and transforming/analyzing faces would also be cool, but out of scope for now).

Model Viewer is free but pretty static and limited. There are paid toolkits that integrate into Blender, but I wanted to get your opinion before opting to pay money. A factor that is more important to me than money at the moment is time - I have a personal website for my prototype and I have my 3d-models. But I don't know which solution fits my purpose best to connect the dots.

1222,6,1ky92g3,unknown,Max for live OSC clip launcher not triggering clips ‚Äì receiving OSC but tracks won‚Äôt fire,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm working on a Max for Live device that listens for OSC messages and launches clips in Ableton based on incoming HRV data. I‚Äôm streaming real-time data from a Polar H10 chest strap into Python, calculating RMSSD, classifying it into low, medium, or high HRV states, and sending an OSC message like /hrv/state 0, /hrv/state 1, /hrv/state 2.

In Max, I‚Äôve built a patch that receives these messages with `[udpreceive 7400]`, unpacks the symbol and integer, and uses `[select 0 1 2]` to route each number to a corresponding message box. See the attached screenshots for reference.

The OSC messages are definitely being received. I can see them printed in the Max console every time the HRV state changes. The scenes in Session View are all populated with audio clips, and they launch properly if I click them manually. The Max patch is loaded on an audio track (I‚Äôve also tried it on a MIDI track), and nothing is muted or misrouted.

The problem is that despite receiving the OSC messages, no clips are launching. There are no errors in the Max console, just no action. I‚Äôm wondering if my Max patch structure is wrong, or if I‚Äôm missing something basic. I'm super new to this so I'm sure I've made some pretty fundamental errors, but I can't figure it out!

1207,6,1ky94z4,unknown,Develop An App,"TL;DR: I want to make a notes taking app thats free to use, no premium, and works in a way that suits my organization, that most other apps don't. What programming language is best to use for this?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I've been working on learning Python for a while, so I could make a game. Eventually I decided I wanted to make a discord bot, and decided to try JavaScript, since ive gotten pretty okay with Python, and ive gotten okay with JavaScript, but here is my problem.

I have an issue where I constantly run into ideas for some small and some large things I want to work on. My newest idea is an app for taking notes, so I can organize all of my ideas.

I am fully aware that apps like that exist, but the problem is, none of them organize how I want them to, I have very specific ideas, and all of them have adds or require premium purchases.

I want to make my own app so I can have it how I want, and put it out for free, so others can also use it without ever adding adds or preventing anyone from being able to use it properly.

Another idea was making a mod for SDV, but its a big idea, which requires me to learn C#, so all in all my question relates to the notes thing specifically.

1236,6,1ky21oi,unknown,üé¨ typed-ffmpeg 3.0 ‚Äì A Python Interface to Build FFmpeg Filter Graphs with Autocomplete + Visual Playground,"Hi all,



I‚Äôve been working on a Python package called¬†[typed-ffmpeg](https://github.com/livingbio/typed-ffmpeg)¬†that makes it easier to work with complex FFmpeg filter graphs‚Äîespecially for those building tools or automations on top of FFmpeg.

Instead of manually writing long CLI strings, you can build graphs in Python using a fully typed, chainable API that supports:

* Autocomplete and IDE support
* Filter argument validation and auto-correction
* JSON serialization of graph structures
* CLI generation from code (and now, the reverse)

# üîß What‚Äôs New in v3.0

This release includes several features aimed at both developers and FFmpeg learners:

# ‚úÖ Source Filter Support

Use source filters like¬†color,¬†testsrc,¬†anullsrc, etc., with full typing and autocomplete.

# ‚úÖ Stream Selector Support

# üß™ Interactive Playground (Web-Based)

Try it: [https://livingbio.github.io/typed-ffmpeg-playground/](https://livingbio.github.io/typed-ffmpeg-playground/)

You can:

* Drag and drop filters to create a graph
* Generate the FFmpeg CLI or typed Python code
* Paste FFmpeg command to reverse-parse it into an editable graph

# üõ†Ô∏è Internal APIs (for tool builders)

v3.0 also introduces internal utilities for:

* Parsing a raw FFmpeg CLI string into a graph
* Emitting typed-ffmpeg Python code from a graph

Let me know what you think ‚Äî I‚Äôd especially appreciate:

* Real-world test cases / edge cases to improve support
* Ideas for how the reverse parser could be smarter
* Contributions or feedback on making this easier for new users

Thanks!
