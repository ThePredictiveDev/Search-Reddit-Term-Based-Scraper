9,1,1ktkhar,post,I've found a really interesting toy! A Busy Betty washing machine made with radioactive Uranium glass!! üíö,"Made by the Hoge Manufacturing Company in New York most likely during the 30s before the war. It was advertised as an educational toy for children. 

In that era, the use of Uranium in glass was very common to make glass green in color. The secondary effect of using Uranium is that the glass will react strongly to UV light. Which makes a beautiful display item to put under a black light! 

The washing machine is in very good condition! The agitator goes back and forth as you rotate the handle continuously in the same direction. Super cool mechanism that still works well! 

Anyway, I'm super happy with my find and just wanted to share!! üòÅ",vendura_na8,vintage,https://reddit.com/r/vintage/comments/1ktkhar/ive_found_a_really_interesting_toy_a_busy_betty/,1399,53,,2025-05-23T19:37:46,2025-05-29T04:50:28.361255,0.2732556818181818,0.9999999999999999

18,1,1ku741o,post,AIO for crashing out over my husband regularly not starting the dishwasher nor washing machine?,"My husband is really fucking pissing me off. 

We are both 33 and have both been out of our parents' houses for over 10 years. His chores are the dishes and his laundry as well as some other small tasks. The issue, he routinely loads them up, turns them on and then doesnt start either machine.

Ive expressed my frustration in healthy ways, Ive helped him when I notice the dishes or laundry havent been started and Ive explained how to make sure you've started either machine (they both make sounds within the first 5 seconds of being started and I feel thats a dead giveaway)

Ive been BUSY at work lately and I have no time to do anything at home except more work for my job. Im exhausted. His job requires zero mental or physical energy and he only works 9 days over 2 weeks.

This week has ended and Im tired and starving. I just finished replying to texts my boss sent me at 12am and I get up to warm up some soup on the stove. For the third time this week the dishwasher is full of nasty half wet dishes covered in rotting food. The smell is awful and I lose it. 

I admit I dont need to be yelling at anyone at 1am but I was and am livid. I cannot possibly do everything, I cant follow around a grown man making sure he completes simple fucking tasks. He is literally one button press away from completion. He's pressing the button once which turns the machine on but not pressing it the second time to start the cycle. Then he doesnt check in a few hours because he has no intentions to unload it.

He had two whole days off this week including yesterday and couldnt complete ONE task. Am I overreacting?

24,1,1kurjiv,post,Heads Up: Costco won't disconnect your old washing machine during delivery and installation,"I ordered a new washer from Costco because my current one broke. I waited all day for delivery, and when the team arrived, they told me they couldn‚Äôt install the new unit because the old one wasn‚Äôt disconnected.

I had no idea this was something I needed to do ahead of time. I even asked them if it was a quick process and if it was, I‚Äôd be happy to work on it while they brought the new washer up. But they just told me they couldn‚Äôt touch it at all, and I‚Äôd have to reschedule the whole thing.

I looked at the site afterward and saw the policy saying:

&gt;‚ÄúThe delivery team will not disconnect old units; old unit must be disconnected in order to hookup new units.‚Äù

Which is completely on me. But honestly, this isn‚Äôt something that was clearly emphasized during the order process, and it assumes every customer knows how or is physically able to do all that.

In my case, the washer is too heavy that I can't move it, and the back and sides are so close to the wall that accessing the water hoses and drain pipe would require climbing over the machine and working in a super awkward position. There‚Äôs also not enough space behind it to put a bucket down when removing the drain hose, so water would spill everywhere. It‚Äôs not impossible for me to do, but it‚Äôs a lot for one person, especially without experience.

I'm a bit frustrated with the experience, especially because Costco usually has fantastic service.

Does anyone know if other companies or installers usually help with disconnecting the old units, or is this standard practice everywhere?",Crazy_Program502,Appliances,https://reddit.com/r/Appliances/comments/1kurjiv/heads_up_costco_wont_disconnect_your_old_washing/,148,194,,2025-05-25T07:29:30,2025-05-29T04:50:28.367255,0.06257269666360575,0.9999999999999999
